<p class="h2">I sat at every spot at the bar, got to know every regular. Heard a lot of stories. There is both cruelty and honesty among drunks, I both made and saw very strong impressions. While I skated around the edge of the abyss, I never jumped in. I gradually found purpose and pride following the loss. She tried her hardest to reach me, but I did not want to be reached.</p>

<p class="h2">Statue Man is a fixture in downtown Portland, a dedicated performance artist who never breaks character. He juggles orbs, dances in super slow motion, the entire time an unbreaking stoic expression on his face. I saw him once on the bus, the whole time in chiseled character. I felt like I understood.</p>
