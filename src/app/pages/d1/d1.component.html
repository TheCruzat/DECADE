<h2>Thanks / Shouts</h2>
<p>Special thanks to Andrew P, Mike M, Jamie M, Lorie H, and the ghosts in the Fremont House. The bartender at Peter's who loved MF Doom.</p>
<p>Ben G and Todd S were the OG, the pioneers, the conquerors.</p>
<p>Ben M, who could drink a surprising amount for his size. Geordi S &amp; Carrie A get the fist bump for coming to visit and remaining true. Ben S for putting up with my shit for five months. Josh &amp; Michelle M, Laurie H and whatsername for putting up with it after.</p>

<p>My Coffee Crutch crew… thank you for giving me the first scene in my new city. To the young homey who ran that place, I blank on the name (probably Ben) but you had that wise old man hustle and inspired the hell out of me. Still do a tip of the hat to Nick and Bailey's Tap Room. </p>

<p>Pro shouts to Joe L, Carrie A, Jen J, Liz M, Ryan S, Deborah S, Jeremy H, Mike B, Amy C, Adam S, Angela H, Marco F, Olga K, Damien B, and that sketchy ass attorney in Tigard.</p>

<p>xoxo Dr Sara Kitten for wearing those jeans<br>
xoxo Jackie S for getting me to Cascadia in the first place</p>

<!-- <h2>What Is This?</h2>
<p>I never stopped working on new material, but over the past 10 years I haven’t cared much about releases or promotion. I’m marking my time in PDX with D/EC/AD/E, four books that collect various beats, demos and songs into a semi fictional narrative. Hopefully it won't be another ten years before PdP takes flight.</p> -->

<p class="h2">Next to the Fremont House was a bodega run by a great Korean family, they also did clothing repairs and alterations. We hit up that bodega for beer regular. The 501 jeans van lived in the parking lot of that bodega for more than 10 years, sadly by 2009 it had disappeared. The bodega closed in 2011, the same year the last generation of our colony left Fremont. Now, where we once played music, there are three condo buildings, and our beloved bodega is a Fire on the Mountain. To be fair, FotM has bomb ass wings.</p>
